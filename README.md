# Movie Revenue Prediction
 For this project we will be training a machine learning model that can predict revenue of a movie based on its genre, keywords, release date and other features

## Overview

This project involves training a machine learning model to predict the revenue of a movie based on various features such as genre, keywords, release date, and other movie statistics. The data for this project was scrapped from The Movie Database (TMDB) website.

## Challenges

One of the main challenges encountered in this project was handling the cleaning of the data, as it consisted of both categorical text data and numerical movie statistics. 

## Machine Learning Pipeline

Various parts of the machine learning pipeline were executed during this project:
- **Data Cleaning**: The data was cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, categorical variables, and other inconsistencies.
- **Feature Engineering**: Features were transformed into useful information for the model, including encoding categorical variables, handling text data, and creating new features.
- **Model Training**: Different machine learning models were trained on the processed data to predict movie revenue.
- **Model Evaluation**: The performance of each model was evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics to select the best-performing model.
- **Model Deployment**: The best performing model was saved to be integrated and deployed in a web application for real-world usage.

## Future Improvements

Further improvement of this project could involve enhancing the results through more advanced feature engineering techniques, exploring additional models, and fine-tuning hyperparameters for better performance.

## Lessons Learned

This project provided valuable learning experiences, including handling heterogeneous data types, implementing various steps of the machine learning pipeline, and understanding the complexities involved in predicting movie revenue.
